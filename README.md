### Setup & How To Submit

If you have any questions about how to get setup or how to submit your homework,
simply start a new Discussion on Canvas; or if you prefer, send me a private
message using the "Inbox" feature in Canvas.


1. Get the code for this assignment by downloading a ZIP file of this repository.
2. Unzip into a folder on your computer, and (optional) rename the folder to `hw1`.
3. Turn the folder into a local git repository.
4. Create a new, remote *private* repository named `mpcs52553-hw1` inside of your GitHub or BitBucket account.
5. Push your local repository to the remote repository.
6. Solve the challenges below.  Commit your changes often to save your work.
7. Push commits as often as you want.  I will not clone your repository until the assignment is due.
8. Prior to the deadline, add me as a collaborator (read+write): `jeffcohen` (works for both GitHub and BitBucket)

### Challenge #1 [not graded]

 Install the following Chrome extensions.  They will help you throughout the course.

 * Web Developer
 * ColorZilla
 * WhatFont


### Challenge #2 [not graded]

 Try answering everything on the attached `db_self_test.pdf`.
 Similar questions will be fair game on Quiz 1 on Jan 22, so if you have any
 trouble be sure to schedule office hours with Rachel or myself.

### Challenge #3: Validating HTML 5 documents [1 point]

1. Open [make_valid.html](make_valid.html) in Chrome.  Notice that Chrome can display it even though it isn't a strictly valid HTML5 document.
2. Use the [HTML5 Validation Service](https://html5.validator.nu) to upload the file and check it for validation errors.
3. Modify the file and re-check the file until no errors remain.

HINT: Here is a screenshot of how to use the service on a local file:

### Challenge #4: Understanding Stylesheet Cascades [4 points]

The [make_nice.html](make_nice.html) file is an ugly part of an old syllabus from last summer.
Your task is to write CSS rules to make it look nice.

1. Open [make_nice.html](make_nice.html) in Chrome.  Compare with [already_nice.png](already_nice.png)
2. See [nice_specs.png](nice_specs.png) for detailed requirements.
3. Put your style rules in [make_nice.css](make_nice.css). You may modify `make_nice.html` as necessary,
but you may _not_ use a `<style>` element anywhere in the HTML.
